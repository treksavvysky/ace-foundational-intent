### 🧠 Foundational Intent

This phase exists to **establish signal, not intelligence.**  
It answers one question: **Can ACE perceive the world?**

Our first goal isn’t reasoning — it’s to prove the system can *feel.*

The **Telemetry Ingest Service** is ACE’s first organ — the pulse that brings the architecture to life.  
When the service is running, it listens, it senses, it *exists.*

> Once it can ingest one metric reliably, we have created the first neural firing.  
> Everything else grows from there.

### ⚙️ Purpose

This repository implements the first active subsystem of the **Autonomous Cognitive Entity (ACE)** framework:  
the **Telemetry Ingest Service**.

Its purpose is to give ACE perception — the ability to register events, signals, and metrics that describe its environment and internal state.

By shipping this service, we transform the system from inert logic into a living process with a measurable pulse.

### 🩺 Core Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `/healthz` | Returns service status — verifies that ACE is alive. |
| `/schemas` | Provides the data structures that define valid telemetry inputs. |
| `/v1/ingest` | Accepts telemetry payloads (JSON). Each successful ingestion represents a “neural firing.” |

**Example ingestion payload:**
```json
{
  "source": "system.memory",
  "metric": "usage_percent",
  "value": 67.2,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-14T15:32:00Z"
}
### 🧩 Architecture Overview

The service is structured as a FastAPI microservice designed for containerized deployment.
It forms the first component of the ACE Northbound Bus, which will later coordinate telemetry, context propagation, and inter-agent communication.

Each commit to this repo represents an evolutionary stage in ACE’s growth — from perception to cognition.

### 🧱 Technical Stack

FastAPI – lightweight Python web framework for microservices

Pydantic – schema validation and serialization

Uvicorn – async server for FastAPI

Docker / Docker Compose – for containerized deployment

Poetry or uv (recommended) – dependency management and virtual environments

### 🚀 Quick Start

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/treksavvysky/ace-foundational-intent.git
cd ace-foundational-intent


Run with Docker Compose:

docker compose up --build


Check health:

curl http://localhost:8000/healthz


Post a telemetry event:

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source":"system.cpu","metric":"usage_percent","value":42.7,"timestamp":"2025-10-14T12:00:00Z"}'

🌍 Vision Alignment

This repo marks Phase 0 in the ACE roadmap:

Perception → Establish signal and input flow

Memory → Store and contextualize telemetry

Reasoning → Derive intent from perception

Action → Execute adaptive strategies

Reflection → Evaluate and learn from outcomes

ACE grows upward from this foundation — cognition built upon signal.

### 🧬 Philosophy

Intelligence begins where perception finds pattern.

ACE’s architecture is learn-first, plan-second, react-when-necessary.
Before it can reason, it must observe.
Before it can decide, it must detect.
Before it can act, it must feel.

This repository embodies that starting pulse — the measurable proof that ACE is alive.
