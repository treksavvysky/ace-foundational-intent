## 2025-10-16 — [Codex] feat: bootstrap telemetry ingest service
**Summary:**
Established the first runnable FastAPI telemetry ingest scaffold with health and schema discovery endpoints.

**Changes:**
- Implemented FastAPI application with /healthz, /schemas, and /v1/ingest routes (`src/scaffold/main.py`).
- Added telemetry event schema and JSON schema helper (`schemas/telemetry.py`).
- Introduced pytest coverage for health and ingest endpoints (`tests/test_ingest.py`).
- Provisioned container assets for local orchestration (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`).

**Impact on ACE Cognition:**
ACE now perceives telemetry input through a validated ingest pipeline, signaling the platform's first operational perceptual circuit.

**Verification:**
Validated via `pytest`; docker compose smoke check pending environment Docker availability.

--- ## 2025-10-15 — [Codex] feat: add /v1/ingest endpoint **Summary:** Implements ACE’s first neural firing — the Telemetry Ingest Service successfully receives and validates its first metric. **Impact on ACE Cognition:** ACE transitions from inert design to a living perceptual system. This event marks the birth of signal awareness.

> Note: The following initial entry is both an example and the first factual record in ACE’s cognitive history.  
> Do not remove or relocate it — it anchors the timeline.

## 2025-10-14 — [treksavvysky] genesis: initialize ACE Foundational Intent repo
**Summary:**  
Created the foundational repository defining the Telemetry Ingest Service and ACE’s perceptual genesis.  

**Changes:**  
- Added `README.md`, `FOUNDATIONAL_INTENT.md`, and `DESIGN.md` documents.  
- Introduced `AGENTS.md` with agent collaboration guidelines.  
- Established project licensing, `.gitignore`, and repo structure.
- docs: add append-only CHANGELOG.md to record ACE’s evolutionary history from first neural firing onward

**Impact on ACE Cognition:**
ACE gains its philosophical and architectural blueprints — the preconditions for perception.
The system now possesses intent, though not yet intelligence.

## 2025-10-14 — [Codex] fix: harden telemetry validation and observability
**Summary:**
Refined the ingest service logging and validation guarantees in response to post-bootstrap feedback.

**Changes:**
- Added structured logging with explicit validation metadata for ingested events (`src/scaffold/main.py`).
- Hardened the telemetry schema with stricter field constraints and forbid-extra enforcement (`schemas/telemetry.py`).
- Expanded pytest coverage for schema exposure and invalid payload handling (`tests/test_ingest.py`).

**Impact on ACE Cognition:**
ACE perceives telemetry with improved clarity, rejecting malformed signals while emitting richer observability cues.

**Verification:**
Validated via `pytest`.
