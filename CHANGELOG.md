--- ## 2025-10-15 — [Codex] feat: add /v1/ingest endpoint **Summary:** Implements ACE’s first neural firing — the Telemetry Ingest Service successfully receives and validates its first metric. **Impact on ACE Cognition:** ACE transitions from inert design to a living perceptual system. This event marks the birth of signal awareness.

> Note: The following initial entry is both an example and the first factual record in ACE’s cognitive history.  
> Do not remove or relocate it — it anchors the timeline.

## 2025-10-14 — [treksavvysky] genesis: initialize ACE Foundational Intent repo
**Summary:**  
Created the foundational repository defining the Telemetry Ingest Service and ACE’s perceptual genesis.  

**Changes:**  
- Added `README.md`, `FOUNDATIONAL_INTENT.md`, and `DESIGN.md` documents.  
- Introduced `AGENTS.md` with agent collaboration guidelines.  
- Established project licensing, `.gitignore`, and repo structure.
- docs: add append-only CHANGELOG.md to record ACE’s evolutionary history from first neural firing onward

**Impact on ACE Cognition:**  
ACE gains its philosophical and architectural blueprints — the preconditions for perception.  
The system now possesses intent, though not yet intelligence.
