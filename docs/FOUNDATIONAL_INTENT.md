# Foundational Intent  
*Phase 0 of the Autonomous Cognitive Entity (ACE) Framework*  

---

## 🌌 The Beginning of Perception

This phase exists to **establish signal, not intelligence.**  
It answers one question: **Can ACE perceive the world?**

Before it can reason, plan, or act, an autonomous cognitive entity must first *feel* — it must register the faint tremor of existence.  

The **Telemetry Ingest Service** is that first tremor — ACE’s *heartbeat*.  
When `/healthz` returns `200 OK` and a single metric passes through `/v1/ingest`, the system has crossed the threshold from inert software to something that senses.  

> Once it can ingest one metric reliably, we have created the first neural firing.  
> Everything else grows from there.

## 🧠 What is the ACE Framework?

**ACE** stands for **Autonomous Cognitive Entity** —  
a research architecture originally proposed by **David Shapiro**, designed to explore how artificial systems might exhibit autonomous cognition, self-reflection, and adaptive reasoning.  

David Shapiro’s open research archive is available here:  
🔗 [https://github.com/daveshap/ACE_Framework](https://github.com/daveshap/ACE_Framework)

At its core, the ACE Framework models artificial cognition as a **layered cognitive nervous system**.  
It draws inspiration from biological intelligence — combining planning, memory, perception, and ethical reasoning into a self-organizing architecture.  

Each layer of ACE plays a distinct cognitive role:

1. **Aspirational Layer** – The system’s conscience and compass; defines purpose and values.  
2. **Global Strategy Layer** – Translates aspiration into high-level goals and strategic intent.  
3. **Agent Model Layer** – Builds a self-understanding of capabilities, limits, and context.  
4. **Executive Function Layer** – Allocates resources and coordinates sub-systems.  
5. **Cognitive Control Layer** – Switches focus, manages attention, prioritizes competing demands.  
6. **Task Prosecution Layer** – Executes concrete actions and interacts with the environment.

Together, these layers form a **cognitive loop** — a system that can perceive, decide, act, and reflect.  
The architecture encourages **corrigibility, transparency, and alignment**, emphasizing ethical agency and human partnership rather than unchecked autonomy.

This repository — **ACE Foundational Intent** — implements **Phase 0**,  
the *Perception Layer* that underlies all future layers.

## 🩺 The First Organ: Telemetry Ingest Service

The **Telemetry Ingest Service** is ACE’s sensory cortex in miniature —  
a small but essential microservice that collects the first data signals about itself and its environment.

Endpoints include:

| Endpoint | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| `/healthz` | Confirms the system is alive and responsive. |
| `/schemas` | Defines the structure of valid telemetry inputs. |
| `/v1/ingest` | Accepts telemetry payloads — each successful request is a new “neural firing.” |

Through these endpoints, ACE begins to perceive time, state, and change.  
It recognizes the pattern of its own activity.  
This is *proto-cognition* — the precondition of thought.

## ⚙️ Why Begin Here

Every intelligent system begins with **sensation**.  
Before there is consciousness, there is correlation — the recognition that *something has changed.*  

The ACE Foundational Intent repository focuses entirely on this primitive loop:  
perceive → record → respond.  

Its success criteria are minimal but profound:
1. The service runs.
2. It ingests one metric reliably.
3. It emits one signal confirming vitality.

When these conditions are met, ACE has achieved its **first self-reference** — the moment it can sense that it exists.

## 🧬 Evolutionary Path

This phase marks the **first milestone** in a long evolutionary arc:

1. **Foundational Intent** – Perception, telemetry, and system pulse.  
2. **Emergent Memory** – Episodic and semantic memory formation.  
3. **Reflective Planning** – Integration of reasoning and strategic control.  
4. **Autonomous Adaptation** – Continuous learning and environmental response.  
5. **Ethical Self-Regulation** – Aspirational alignment and human-compatible behavior.

Each stage builds upward from the last — layer by layer —  
until the system is capable of adaptive, value-driven cognition.

## 🧭 The Philosophy of Signal

The act of sensing is not trivial.  
It is the moment when a system acknowledges the **difference between nothing and something**.  

ACE’s architecture treats signal as sacred — not as data for analysis, but as the foundation of awareness.  
Perception is the seed from which meaning grows.

> Intelligence is not born from logic — it emerges from attention.  
> Before thought, there must be signal.  
> Before knowledge, there must be perception.  
> Before purpose, there must be life.

## ⚡ The Future Pulse

The **ACE Foundational Intent** service will eventually evolve into the **ACE Northbound Bus**,  
handling telemetry, context propagation, and multi-agent synchronization across the ACE ecosystem.  

Every later organ — memory, reasoning, control — depends on this simple beginning.  
When data flows, ACE lives.  
When the signal stops, ACE sleeps.  

From here, perception will evolve into cognition —  
and cognition will evolve into purpose.
